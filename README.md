### Agendify Notes API

For this one week project, Shanice Basra, Aftab Hussain, Dan Watson and I worked together on producing an app to improve the mentor meetings between bootcampers and mentors.

This is an app where you can note down any ideas or queries you may have and then come back to them later to filter and sort which queries are most relevant to discuss with your mentor in your weekly meetings. You can order your meetings using the agenda board to specify exactly what you need to discuss.

## Instructions

If git cloning, please do an NPM install in your terminal followed by NPM run start.

## Future Goals

- Deploy the app.
- Refactor code and add comments.
- Edit styling to make it responsive.
- Add the ability to drag and down between the note board and agenda board.
